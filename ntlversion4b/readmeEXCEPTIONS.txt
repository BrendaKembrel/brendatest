-FOR PROMOS:
-sitewide promos are combinable with all promos, without exception, even non combinable promos.  The reason for this is that sitewide promos
are more like specials than promos

FOR PRODUCTS:
-there can only be one default image
-you can't have a "generate" page for a default image because, otherwise when getting all products, you'd get both the default version and the generate page, both of which 
would have the same image
